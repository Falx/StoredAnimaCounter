# Stored Anima Counter

This addon counts your stored Anima, that is Anima sitting in your bag but not added to your reservoir yet. It is exposed as an LDB data source feed, so you can display it with any addon that displays LDB data sources.

This is a first implementation, more visualisation options will be added later.

## Usage

Example ElvUI

* Go to `/ec` (ElvUI config panel)
* `DataTexts`
* `Panels`
* Pick a panel and click the dropdown of a `Position`
* Select `Stored Anima`
